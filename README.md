# Market Reversal Alerts Dashboard

**Developer:** Forex Robot Easy Team

**Program:** Market Reversal Alerts Dashboard

This code is a sample implementation of a market reversal alerts dashboard. It is designed to provide professional forex traders with real-time alerts for potential market reversals. The dashboard allows traders to select a currency pair and time frame, and upon clicking the alert button, it performs a reversal analysis and generates alerts if a reversal is detected.

## Features

- Easy to use dashboard interface
- Select currency pair and time frame
- Perform reversal analysis
- Generate alerts for potential market reversals
- Real-time updates on alert status

## How It Works

The code uses the MQL library to import necessary libraries and create chart objects such as buttons, labels, and combo boxes. It initializes the dashboard by setting up the chart objects and adding currency pairs and time frames to the respective combo boxes.

The `OnChartEvent` function handles the button click event. When the alert button is clicked, it retrieves the selected currency pair and time frame from the combo boxes. It then calls the `PerformReversalAnalysis` function to perform the reversal analysis. If a reversal is detected, it sends an alert to the trader using the `SendAlert` function and updates the alert label.

The `PerformReversalAnalysis` function is a placeholder for the actual reversal analysis logic. In this code, it generates a random number and returns `true` if the number is 1, simulating a reversal detection.

The `SendAlert` function is also a placeholder for the actual alert sending mechanism. In this code, it simply prints a message to the console with the currency pair and time frame.

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the program is shut down. It cleans up the chart objects by deleting them.
